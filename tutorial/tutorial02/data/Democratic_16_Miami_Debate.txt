That processpecifically.

CLINTON: Karen, I'moingo follow my friend Senator Sanders modelere. If I'mo fortunate enougho behe Democraticominee,here will beotfimeoalkboutim. I washe firstneo callimut. I calledimut whene was calling Mexicansapists.

SANDERS: This is what Ihink. Ihinkhathe American peoplereeveroingo elect president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans. Andetsot forgethateveral yearsgo, Trump was inhe middlefheo- called birther movement,ryingo delegitimizehe presidentfhe United Statesf America. [applause]

You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland. I knowittle bitbouthe immigrant experience. Nobodyas eversked me for my birth certificate. Maybe itasomethingo do withhe colorf mykin. [applause]

RAMOS: On [inaudible], peoplerealkingbout immigration,ndhis maphows where inhe countryheyrealkingbout ithe most.

Maria Elena?

SALINAS: So Secretary, Iave question for you. In 2003, youaidnadiohow,pecifically it was John Gambling'sadiohow in New York,hat you weredamantlygainst illegal immigrantsndhat peopleaveotop employing illegal immigrants. Yourew immigration plan ishat you would expand President Obama's executivectionsndhat you would push foregislationhat would include patho citizenship forndocumented immigrants.

So,re you flip-floppingnhis issue? Orre you panderingo Latinos, whatome would call Hispandering? [laughter]

CLINTON: In 2003, Iponsoredhe DREAMER Act. Iponsored Ihink in every Congressfterhat. Iave been consistentnd committedo comprehensive immigrationeform with patho citizenship.

Ihinkur best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedyedhe chargen comprehensive immigrationeform. Weave Republicanupport. Wead president willingoign it. I voted forhat bill. Senator Sanders votedgainst it.

Justhink, imagine where we would beoday is weadchieved comprehensive immigrationeformine yearsgo. Imagineow much moreecure families would be inur country,oonger fearinghe deportationfovedne;oonger fearinghathey would be foundut.

So Imtaunchly in favorf comprehensive immigrationeformndave beenoverhe coursef my public career. [applause]

SALINAS: Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you votedgainst immigrationeform. Youowayhat it was becausehe billaduestworker provisions whicheemedemi-slavery. But backhen,his is what youaido CNN's Lou Dobbs. Let'sisten.

[begin video clip]

SANDERS: Poverty is increasing. And if wagesreoing down, I don't know why weeed millionsf peopleo be coming intohis countrysuestworkers who will work forower wageshan American workersnd drive wages down evenowerhanheyreightow.

[end video clip]

[crosstalk]

SALINAS: So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions foruestworkers,really because youhink immigrants drive down wagesndake jobs from Americans?

SANDERS: Well, youaveuestworker programshatave been described byhe Southern Poverty Law Center,nefhe important institutions inhis country whotudieshese issues,suestworkers programskinolavery, where people came in. They were cheated. They werebused. They wereumiliated. And ifheytoodp forheirights,hey would behrownutfhe country.

Of course,hatypef [inaudible]eadsoaceohe bottom forllfur people. And I worked veryardnhat issue. Andf course, Iupportedhe 2013 immigrationeform bill. And what I believeightow isotnlyhat weeed comprehensive immigrationeform, ifhe Congress doesot do its job,s presidentfhe United States I willsehe executive powersfhatfficeo do whataso be done,o do what President Obama did,nd expandnhat.

SALINAS: But if you'reayinghat you would...[applause]...if you'reayinghat you would expandnhe executivections,ow do youhathey'reotoingo endp inegal battle justike Obama's executivections?

SANDERS: Well, we dohe best — we don't know. And Ihouldlsoay withegardohat 2007 immigration bill,s you may know, LULAC,he major Hispanicrganization inis country,lsopposedhat bills did manyther Latinorganizations.

Buto your point, weaveo dohe best we can. Ipplaud President Obama foris effortsn DAPAnd DACA. And Ihink weaveoto expandhose efforts.

CLINTON: If I could...[applause] You know, Ihink it's veryardo makehe casehat Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta,eadersfhe Latino community, wouldaveupported billhatctually promoted modernlavery. That wasnefhe many excusessedoto vote forhe 2007 bill.

And I willo backo what Iaid. If wead beenbleoethat passed, we would beo much furtherlongow. I'm committedo defending DAPAnd DACA. I'm committedooing even furtheroet more people deferredction,oos fars I cannderheaw. And Im committedo introducing comprehensive immigrationeform with patho citizenship inhe first 100 daysf my presidency.

SALINAS: Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator, would youikeoespond?

SANDERS: Well, when wealkbout effortsossist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailedponheovernorf New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wantedo doheighthingnd provide driver'sicenseohese who werendocumented,heaid don't do it,nd New York Statetill doesot do it. In Vermont, byhe way, I worked withfficialsndndocumented people in Vermont doavehebilityoet driver'sicense. [applause]

When wealkbout immigration,heecretary willememberhatnefhereatragedies,umanragediesfecent years is children came from Honduras wherehere's probably more violencehanlmostny place inhis country,ndhey came intohis country. And Iaid welcomehose children intohis country, Secretary Clintonaidendhem back. That's difference.

CLINTON: Let me —et meespondgain becausehe misrepresentation can'tonansweredere.

Firstfll,hat isomethinghat isot fairbout what Iaid. I diday weeededo be very concernedboutittle children comingohis country —nheirwn, veryften — manyfhemot making it. And whenheyotere,heyeeded,s Iavergued for,egal counsel, due process,o make decision. Weeedo end private detention, weeedo end family detention.

And in 2006, when Senator Sanders wasunning forhe Senate from Vermont,e voted inhe House withard-line Republicans for indefinite detention forndocumented immigrants,ndheneided withhose Republicansotand with vigilantes knowns Minute Men who wereakingputpostslonghe borderount down immigrants.

So Ihink when you wereunning forhe Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator,hat you wereoingotand withhe Republicans. When youotohe Senate in 2007,nefhe firsthings you did was votegainst Ted Kennedy's immigrationeform whiche'd been workingn for years before you everrrived.

SALINAS: Oneastesponse. [applause]

SANDERS: Let meespond —et meespondohat.

SALINAS: Gohead.

SANDERS: You know, Ted Kennedy was very close friendf mine,nd Iervednhe committeee chaired,he Health, Education, Labor Committee. And Ted Kennedy was kind enoughollow meooldearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing withhe plightfndocumentedomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida. [applause]

And I wentheren mywn. Wasn'tn issueeally forhetatef Vermonto exposeheorrendous working conditionsndheemilavery, if youike,hathose workersivednder. Andheesultfhatearingndhe workhat many, many people did wasoignificantly improvehe wagesnd working conditionsfhose workers. [applause]

However,ast November in New Hampshire, youpenlyaidhatsenator you votedumerousimeso buildhe wall with Mexico. What'she difference between what you did, votingo buildhe wall,nd what Donald Trump wantso doow?

CLINTON: Well, Ihink bothfs, both Senator Sandersnd I, votedumerousimeso enhance borderecuritylongur border. We increasedheumberf borderecuritygents. We did vote for moneyo build fence, pedestrian fence inome place, vehicle fence inther places. Andheesult ishat weavehe mostecure border we've everad.

Apprehensions comingcrosshe borderreheowesthey've been in 40 years, which justtrengthens myrgumenthatow it'simeo do comprehensive immigrationeform.

The Republicans,hepponentsoongeravenrgument. And certainly, weearot coming fromhe Republicanidehat isbsolutelyutfouch witheality. Weaised moneyhroughhe congressionalppropriations process. We enhancedhe borderecurity. That partfhe work is done.

Everybodyhat I knowasookedt itaid,kay, weaveecure border. There'soeed forhishetoricnd demagogueryhat'still —is carriedutnhe Republicanide. You'veunutf excuses. Let's moveo comprehensive immigrationeform with patho citizenship. And Ihinkhat makes verytrongrgument in favorf doing it.

SALINAS: Buthe question is, what ishe difference betweenhe wallhat you voted fornd Donald Trump's wall?

CLINTON: It's big difference. Firstfll,s Inderstandim,e'salkingbout veryall wall. [laughter]

Right? A beautifulall wall. The most beautifulall wall, betterhanhe Great Wallf China,hat wouldunhe entire border. Thate wouldomehow magicallyethe Mexicanovernmento pay for. And, you know, it's just fantasy. And in fact, ife caredo knownythingbout what membersf Congress,ikeheenatornd Iave done, where it wasecessary, we didupportome fencing.
